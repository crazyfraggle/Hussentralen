# Home automation central

This is my little home automation central playground. It is mostly an experiment
in using a [Svelte] app to view the status of "smart" devices in my house at a
single location.

## Philips Hue lights

The initial trigger for the project was installation of Philips [Hue] lights
around the house. It turns out that controlling these on a LAN is very easy.

## Today section

A single location for the house member calendars. Powering this through Google
Calendars.

## Weather

Todays weather is provided by [Yr.no](https://yr.no/). Indoor and outdoor
measurements will be read from NetAtmo devices.
